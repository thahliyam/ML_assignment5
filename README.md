This project implements clustering techniques on the Iris dataset to group similar data points without predefined labels. The dataset is preprocessed by removing the species column and applying feature scaling to improve clustering performance. Two clustering algorithms are explored: KMeans Clustering, where the optimal number of clusters is determined using the Elbow Method, and Hierarchical Clustering, implemented using Agglomerative Clustering with a dendrogram visualization. Model performance is evaluated using Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin Index, and Calinski-Harabasz Index,
