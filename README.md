This project explores clustering techniques using the Iris dataset, focusing on KMeans and Hierarchical Clustering to group similar data points. The dataset is preprocessed by removing labels and applying feature scaling before clustering. The Elbow Method helps determine the optimal number of clusters for KMeans, while Agglomerative Clustering is implemented with dendrograms for Hierarchical Clustering. Model performance is evaluated using Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin Index, and Calinski-Harabasz Index, with results indicating that Hierarchical Clustering from File 1 performed best (Silhouette Score = 0.70, Davies-Bouldin Index = 0.36, and Calinski-Harabasz Index = 549.45). These metrics confirm that the clusters are well-defined, compact, and well-separated, demonstrating the effectiveness of clustering algorithms in uncovering patterns in data.
